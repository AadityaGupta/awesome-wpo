## Browsers - Bookmarklet

* [Yahoo YSlow for Mobile/Bookmarklet](https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) - YSlow analyzes web pages and suggests ways to improve their performance based on a set of rules for high performance web pages.
* [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights_extensions) - PageSpeed Insights is available as an open-source browser extension for Google Chrome. Webmasters and web developers can use PageSpeed Insights to evaluate the performance of their web pages and to get suggestions on how to improve them.
* [PerfMap](https://github.com/zeman/perfmap) - A bookmarklet to create a front-end performance heatmap of resources loaded in the browser using the Resource Timing API.

## Metrics Monitor
* [Keepfast](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe/keepfast) - Tool to monitor indicators related to performance of a web page.
* [Showslow](http://www.showslow.com/) - open source tool that helps monitor various website performance metrics over time. It captures the results of YSlow, Page Speed Insights, WebPageTest and dynaTrace AJAX Edition.
* [Bench](https://github.com/jmervine/bench) - Using Phantomas (a PhantomJS backed client performance metrics scrapper). Benchmark a page, store results in MongoDB and display result via the built in server.

## Minifiers

* [YUI Compressor](https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor) - JavaScript compressor which, in addition to removing comments and white-spaces, obfuscates local variables using the smallest possible variable name. This obfuscation is safe, even when using constructs such as 'eval' or 'with' (although the compression is not optimal is those cases) Compared to jsmin, the average savings is around 20%.

## Javascript benchmark

* [JSlitmus](https://github.com/broofa/jslitmus) - JSLitmus is a lightweight tool for creating ad-hoc JavaScript benchmark tests.


## Online Tools

* [Pingdom Website Speed Test](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) - Test the load time of that page, analyze it and find bottlenecks
* [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) - Run a free website speed test from multiple locations around the globe using real browsers (IE and Chrome) and at real consumer connection speeds. You can run simple tests or perform advanced testing including multi-step transactions, video capture, content blocking and much more. Your results will provide rich diagnostic information including resource loading waterfall charts, Page Speed optimization checks and suggestions for improvements.



## Miscellaneous

* [Socialite.js](http://socialitejs.com/) - Socialite provides a very easy way to implement and activate a plethora of social sharing buttons â€” any time you wish. On document load, on article hover, on any event!
